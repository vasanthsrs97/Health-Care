FRACTURE	Fractures are different from other injuries to the skeleton such as dislocations, although in some cases it can be hard to tell them apart. Sometimes, a person may have more than one type of injury. If in doubt, treat the injury as if it is a fracture.The symptoms of a fracture depend on the particular bone and the severity of the injury, but may include:Pain,Swelling,Bruising,Deformity,Inability to use the limb.	CAUSES	Traumatic incidents such as sporting injuries, vehicle accidents and falls(or)Conditions such as osteoporosis and some types of cancer that cause bones to fracture more easily, meaning even minor trauma and falls can become serious.	FIRSTAID	Good first-aid care of fractures is always important. Moving the broken bones can increase pain and bleeding and can damage tissues around the injury. This can lead to complications in the repair and healing of the injury later on.First aid for fractures is all about immobilising (limiting movement of) the injured area. Splints can be used for this. Control any external bleeding. Complicated breaks where a limb is very deformed may need to be realigned before splinting – only paramedics or medical staff should do this.	Fractures of the head or body such as skull, ribs and pelvis are all serious and should be managed by paramedics.Keep the person still – do not move them unless there is an immediate danger, especially if you suspect fracture of the skull, spine, ribs, pelvis or upper leg
