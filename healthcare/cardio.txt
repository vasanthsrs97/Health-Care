CARDIAC ARREST	Sudden cardiac arrest may not be as sudden as doctors have thought, researchers report.Roughly half of cardiac arrest patients experience telltale warning signs that their heart is in danger of stopping in the month preceding their attack, new study findings suggest. Those symptoms can include any combination of chest pain and pressure, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and flu-like sensations (such as nausea, back pain and/or abdominal pain), the researchers said. The problem: less than one in five of those who experience symptoms actually reach out for potentially lifesaving emergency medical assistance, the investigators found.	CAUSES	\N	FIRST AID	Quickly check the unconscious person's breathing. If he or she isn't breathing normally, begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest - at the rate of 100 to 200 compressions a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway and deliver rescue breathes after every 30 compressions.	If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. Keep doing this until a portable defrillator is available or emergency personnel arrive.
